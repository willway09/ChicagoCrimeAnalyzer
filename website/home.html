                        <h4>Overview and Description</h4>
                        <p>The City of Chicago provides a useful dashboard for visually viewing and interacting with
                            crime data.
                            However, the visuals it provides appear to just be from simple queries on the data -
                            examples include the
                            frequency of defined crime types, the amount of crime in community areas (similar to
                            neighborhoods), and
                            total crime over time. The purpose of this application to to offer additional, more complex
                            queries on the
                            same dataset to provide more interesting analysis points. In particular, these queries focus
                            on population
                            crime density (the amount of crime per person in an area) and the motion of crime over the
                            course of a year
                            or more. Users will interact with the application via an intuitive web interface, where they
                            can learn about
                            how to use the application, input query parameters, and visualize query results. </p>

                        <h4>Motivation</h4>
                        <p>This application answers questions which are of interest to the local community. Individuals
                            searching
                            for housing in the city could use this project to avoid moving into an area which is
                            currently experiencing
                            a surge in crime. Police analysts could use it to observe seasonal trends in the motion of
                            crime around
                            the city, and to adjust policing efforts accordingly. Politicians could use it to identify
                            the areas not with
                            the most crime, but with the most crime per person living there (a better metric for needed
                            help), and
                            allocate resources accordingly. This application provides answers that are of general
                            interest to a range of
                            individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The base dataset enumerating the crimes in Chicago currently exceeds 7 million records. The
                            usage of a database allows this data to
                            efficiently stored, indexed,
                            searched, and filtered. Additionally, a database can be used to reduce the size of the
                            data; while the downloaded size of the CSV file containing the crimes is around 1.7Gb, a
                            substantial portion of that is wasted on
                            repeatedly storing information like crime descriptions (which are standardized by a crime
                            code) and dates
                            as strings.Finally, databases
                            allow for the
                            use of SQL, which provides an efficient and standardized way to formulate queries on large
                            amounts of
                            data; the alternative would be to manually write algorithms to interact with the data, which
                            would take
                            much longer and under the hood probably end up being partially redundant with SQL (i.e. this
                            would be
                            wasted effort reinventing the wheel). In the context of this application, because crime
                            trends are of direct
                            interest, using a tool to easily combine data to identify them makes sense. Thus, usage of a
                            database for this
                            project seems appropriate.

                <h4>Web-Based UI Functionality</h4>
                <p>The website is organized to such that the user can navigate to and from the homepage and the
                    other queries via navigation bar.
                    Each of these query pages will start with
                    a description of the query, then will have a form to input query parameters, and a graph to
                    display the
                    output. The specific input will depend on what is needed by the query, though generally
                    categorical values
                    (such as community area name) will be input using a drop-down selection, while numerical
                    values will be
                    input using a slider. An interactable map will be available to select desired regions.
                </p>
                <p>The output
                    is always plotted on a 2D scatterplot.
                </p>
                <h4>Application Goals Regarding Trend Analysis</h4>
                <p>
                    Two general goals of this application are to observe how crime density (not necessarily crime magnitude)
changes over time, and to observe how crime moves in Chicago. In contrast to total crime numbers, crime
density describes how much crime occurs per relevant unit, such as per person or per square kilometer. In
areas with greater crime density, the average person living there will experience the crime more; in contrast,
in areas with lower crime density, the toll is more bearable because it is diffused amongst more people.
It
appears that crime density is a superior metric for assessing crime levels, but isn’t reported immediately
in the dataset; thus, this project focuses on using it in it’s queries, in particular in queries 1, 2, and 5 -
these could directly inform decisions of where to allocate resources to address crime. Also interesting is the
potential for motion of crime around the city. For example, criminals may move back and forth from East
to West as the year progresses, or over the course of the year criminals may move out of one community
area and into it’s neighbors; these area addressed by queries 4 and 5, respectively. This is interesting to
enforcement, as they can allocate resources in anticipation of these trends. It should be noted that query 3
doesn’t address either of these, but still seemed interesting and was thus included.
